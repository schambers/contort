# Contort

Contort is a digital audio distortion plugin built using the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/). Targets VST3 & AU. This plugin was created during a read through of [Designing Audio Effect PLugins in C++](https://amzn.to/325n9YQ). Highly recommended if you're interested in getting started with Digital Signal Processing and Audio software developement.

Some other open source plugins that assisted in the development of this plugin (mainly for researching how to perform various operations):

In addition, as part of researching DSP topics, some aspects of [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) were researched that provides a functional language for performing DSP.
